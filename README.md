## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a UI/UX designer expanding my skill set into front-end development, currently learning how to bring designs to life using HTML and Tailwind CSS. This repository is part of my journey from static mockups to fully functional, responsive interfacesâ€”bridging the gap between design and code.

As a designer, Iâ€™ve always been passionate about crafting clean, intuitive, and user-centered experiences. Now, Iâ€™m taking those skills a step further by learning how to implement them directly in the browser. By working with semantic HTML and utility-first styling through Tailwind CSS, Iâ€™m building a solid foundation in web development while staying true to my design roots.

Tailwind CSS has been an exciting tool to learnâ€”its utility-first approach makes it easier to apply styles directly in markup, speeding up development without compromising on design precision. Iâ€™m also learning how to build responsive layouts, manage spacing and typography, and create reusable components that follow good design and code practices.

This repository includes my personal projects, code experiments, and practice exercises as I sharpen my front-end coding skills. Youâ€™ll find everything from simple landing pages to component libraries, each one a step forward in understanding how design decisions translate into real-world code.

Iâ€™m always open to feedback and suggestionsâ€”whether youâ€™re a fellow designer learning to code or a developer interested in design. Feel free to explore the projects, leave comments, or reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate.

Thanks for stopping by, and hereâ€™s to building beautiful interfacesâ€”one line of code at a time.
